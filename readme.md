# Project Description

According to a recent study (from CBRE) the entire e-commerce sales globally is going to rise from 4 trillion USD to 6.6 trillion USD this year. Also, during the COVID lockdown across the world there has been a sudden surge in the use of ecommerce platforms. We have seen how the use of e-commerce platforms have helped during the pandemic by allowing people to stay indoors and get their items delivered without the hassle to go to retail stores. These are a few points that helped us to decide to build an e commerce website.

In light of these recent events, we are planning to build an e commerce website FlyBuy.com, enabling the customers to choose and order products according to their specifications. The website will have a clean and tidy user interface for a smooth shopping experience. It will provide convenience, flexibility and luxury to order from home and will offer a variety of transaction options. The website will also have real time tracking to get a better understanding on the location of parcels of a customer. Besides product we also aim to provide installation service related to selected items.
